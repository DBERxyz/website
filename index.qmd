This is a (*personal* ) knowledge management project by [Jeff Raker](https://www.jeffraker.xyz).

The goal is to curate resources, information, experiences for moving from as educator to an educational researcher. Whether new to education research, a seasoned researcher, or research trainee mentor, the content of [DBER.xyz](https://www.dber.xyz) includes something for you.

While the URL may suggest a broad focus (i.e., all discipline-based education research), at the moment, the website is developed by a chemical education scholar and thus is primarily focused on chemical education scholarship.
