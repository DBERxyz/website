This is a knowledge management project by [Jeff Raker](https://www.jeffraker.xyz).

The goal is to curate resources, information, experiences for an individual to move from educator to education researcher. Whether new to education research, a seasoned researcher, or research trainee mentor, the content of [DBER.xyz](https://www.dber.xyz) includes something for you.

Content is provided for informational and educational purposes. Collaboration with an educational research expert, participation in formal education research studies and communities of practice, and similar experiences are ideal to developing the knowledge and skills of a education researcher.

While the URL may suggest a broad focus (i.e., all discipline-based education research), at the moment, the website is developed by a chemical education scholar and thus is primarily focused on chemical education scholarship.
