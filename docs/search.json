    "text": "This is a knowledge management project by Jeff Raker.\nThe goal is to curate resources, information, experiences for moving from as educator to an educational researcher. Whether new to education research, a seasoned researcher, or research trainee mentor, the content of DBER.xyz includes something for you.\nWhile the URL may suggest a broad focus (i.e., all discipline-based education research), at the moment, the website is developed by a chemical education scholar and thus is primarily focused on chemical education scholarship."
